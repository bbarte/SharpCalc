# SharpCalc
### Name meaning
Sharp (C#) Calc (calculation spreadsheet)
### What is it
SharpCalc is my attempt to recreate Excel in the console app.
### What does it have
* Inserting data into the cells,
* Changing foreground and background color of the cells,
* Help window
### What does it not have yet
* Formulas (e.g. sum, max, min) ;)
* Saving and reading from the file (it will probably just be a JSON file)
* Scrolling
### How it works?
Simple. Very simple. SharpCalc just stores every item in a list of cells. Every operation on them is done using LINQ.
### Help
Create new document, and type 'help'.
